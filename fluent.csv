,Building a Webapp Step-by-Step - Ohad Kravchick - Part 1,"We will cover several key aspects of building a single page web application. We will start by exploring and properly using MVC in our web app. We will do so by building a simple view or two, using HTML templates, CSS, and JS glue. We will also do some simple models and controllers; We will write some DOM and custom events to decouple our controllers from our views and from our models. I will opt for using an events framework, rather than a full MVC one, as it provides lower prerequisite bar; I will though explore a few of the features we will be missing in a normal MVC framework(like bindings, or syncing to RESTful service), but will also likely show the same code in Backbone; that is unless you prefer sticking to a standardized one. As we build our code, we will add tests to our code: we'll test the views using node.js, mocha, and jsdom. We will also introduce fixtures to mimic our model for testing the views. And, of course, we will also test our controllers and model, this time using spies (sinon.js), to validate the creation and proper messaging. Besides running our tests manually, we will later explore simple grunt integrations for testing and linting, and finish with deploying our code continuously to our servers.",40 minutes,364 MB  ,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/bf8682f0c9818/assets/5812278/file.mp4

,Secrets of Awesome JavaScript API Design - Brandon Satrom,"It doesn't take long for most developers to sniff out a poorly-designed JavaScript API. Within minutes of reading about or coding against a new library, most developers can intuit whether their long-term relationship with that library will be a pleasant or unfortunate one. While documentation, buzz and other factors certainly play into that conclusion, the largest influencer of that snap conclusion is the feel of the API itself. APIs are developer UX: A good one raises a developers enjoyment; a bad one sends it plummeting. As developers, we know what good and bad JavaScript APIs """"feel"""" like, and yet we struggle with designing the kind of APIs that we enjoy using. But principles of good JavaScript API design do exist, and its possible to extract them from several key libraries in the the proliferating JavaScript landscape. In this article, Brandon Satrom will do exactly that, digging into the design aspects of popular libraries like jQuery, Backbone, Modernizer, Kendo UI and others to enumerate the designed-in qualities of these libraries that make them not only popular, but a pleasure to use.",38 minutes,338 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/ea4b8c913c44e/assets/5813709/file.mp4

,DesignOps: Removing Friction from Your Front-end Development Workflow - Jessica Allen,"Implementing UX/UI change is not easy when code is architected without front-end flexibility in mind. If the process for making design changes is cumbersome, it slows down product iteration. Architect your app so that design changes and adding new features can be as frictionless as possible.",31 minutes,282 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/59e6e559e7322/assets/5812416/file.mp4
,Implementing Hypermedia Clients: It's Not Rocket Science - Mike Amundsen,"While it's true that Hypermedia APIs are getting traction in some circles, not much has been said about how this affects client coding. Common thinking is that client coding for hypermedia is either a) unreasonably hard or, b) results in ugly UI/UX that harkens back to the days of early browsers sporting Marquee and Blink tags. Coding hypermedia clients need not be ugly nor complicated. This session shows you how to write clean, adaptive code that responds to changes in data and workflow requirements over time. This session covers the truth (both good and bad) about hypermedia client coding and includes examples of several client models that handle evolvable Hypermedia APIs without sacrificing user experience or requiring Herculean effort on the part of developers.",40 minutes,361 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/48ca763cbdb9d/assets/5813502/file.mp4
,Migrating to Backbone.js - Rushaine McBean,"At the Levo League we make heavy use of JavaScript within our stack. Our development team has guidelines in order to maintain code organization and structure; we knew that we would eventually adopt a client-side framework or library as our web application grew. As a full stack developer, I took the lead on the learning about and comparing the pros and cons of various frameworks and libraries, and tested them by creating few test apps. After deciding on using Backbone.js, our challenge was to apply what we'd tested on a smaller scale to our existing codebase. Before we could implement we had to figure out how many models we needed and how many would be collections; we also had to take into account the number of views associated with each model/collection and if there was a need for routes and events.",25 minutes,228 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/7f6cae61ab1f8/assets/5813444/file.mp4
,Mistakes I Made Building Pinterest Widgets - Kent Brewster,"A year ago I stood up at Fluent and gave a somewhat idealistic talk called Eight Simple Rules for Running Your JavaScript on My Page. Since then Ive had the opportunity to build and deploy Pinterests new JavaScript widgets, which are all made by a single script tag that creates the Pin It button, a Follow Me button, and two kinds of embedded pinboards. This year Id like to come back to Fluent, break open the source code, and talk about how and when I had to break my own rules. Among other things, Ill show: Including third-party scripts with a single line of JavaScript. Passing configuration variables without adding extra SCRIPT tags. Creating structure, styling with CSS, and adding interactions, all without resorting to iframes or external libraries. Avoiding interference with existing and future page elements. Specific to the project: Full source of Pinterests widgets, how anyone can access it, and why its critical to ship source. How and why I pushed back on design. API endpoints and how Im hitting them without running into cross-domain security trouble. Dealing with browser compatibility issues. How and why I avoided using libraries. What I did about analytics and user tracking. Who I broke on launch day, and what I had to do to fix them. What Ill do differently next time.",28 minutes,254 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/a19dea16bc1b2/assets/5813510/file.mp4
,Parallel JavaScript (River Trail) Brings Parallelism to the Web - Richard L. Hudson,"Parallel programming has long been considered the realm of the self-described expert programmer. Locks, memory models, race conditions, hardware anomalies, and complex global reasoning have been the devils that JavaScript banished from the language at its creation. The price has been a sequential language appropriate for the hardware of a decade ago. Parallel JavaScript, code name River Trail, rejects the notion that adding parallelism to JavaScript requires a Faustian bargain. Instead Parallel JavaScript gently extends JavaScript in safe, secure, and programmer friendly ways resulting in the most important performance change web programmers will enjoy over the next few years. This talk will present the work we have done creating a web appropriate and HTML5/JavaScript programmer friendly parallel programming model and implementation. With this as a base the talk will look at exciting applications built using Parallel JavaScript including physics simulations, some augmented reality, and computer vision enabled games. Written entirely in JavaScript these applications provide a glimpse of a future that is increasingly immersive, engaging, and a lot more fun. While the next big application innovation is opaque what is clear is that the reality of the power wall will need to leverage all available parallel hardware including multiple hardware cores, vector instructions, and the increasing parallel and increasingly general GPUs. Parallel JavaScript is the leading contender on how to do this and is rapidly gaining acceptance both in the standards arena as well as in application arenas as the answer to evolving JavaScript into a more parallel world.",48 minutes,434 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/eda97da21869c/assets/5813445/file.mp4

,Angry Birds of Modern JavaScript Development - Elijah Manor,"A diabolical herd of pigs stole all of the front-end architecture from an innocent flock of birds and now they want it back! A team of special agent hero birds will attack these despicable pigs until they recover what is rightfully theirs, front-end architecture! The Red Birds attacks with the force of their trusty IIFE, the basic building block of all privacy. The Blue Bird follows in his footsteps and triggers events and messages that scatter to infiltrate the pigs castle. The Yellow Bird comes with a Require.JS speed booster and dynamically injects scripts against those pesky swine. The Black Bird is soon to follow and he provides a much more organized approach to fighting these porkers and introduces the Backbone.js bomb to their dismay. The White Bird appears to be seemingly harmless, but when it pulls out its strict coding style and bursts of quality checks the hogs are sure to squeal. The Green Bird can reach all of those hard to reach places and will mock and spy those stealing swine right where it hurts! The Orange Bird starts out small with a simple template, but then expands itself into a DOM blast that will surely send the message that the birds mean business. The Big Brother is not too far behind and he is pulling out the big guns with his finite state machine and other proven design patterns of destruction. The Mighty Eagle pulls up the ranks with a superior weapon of them all, a suite of tools that can organize and deploy all the other birds into battle against their soon to be be vanquished foe.",39 minutes,355 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/dc6d95756c0a1/assets/5812027/file.mp4
,Secure RESTful API Automation with JavaScript - Jonathan LeBlanc,"Pragmatic RESTful API principles, along with a solid consumption architecture, can allow for a great amount of automation in your program development. At the same time, securing the application can be extremely tricky from JavaScript. In this session we will explore several principles behind RESTful API design and consumption using JavaScript, many of the standards that were integrated in the redevelopment of the PayPal API architecture in the new RESTful APIs.

,Flow Control with Promises - Trevor Burnham,"This is a sequel to my talk from last year, The Promised Land. I saw many developers tweet that they enjoyed the talk but found it a little basic. This talk will start with a 10-minute review on the basics of Promises, then go into a more advanced topic: how Promises can be used as an alternative to a flow control library like Async.js. Async.js is one of the most popular libraries in the Node world (see the Most Depended Upon list at https://npmjs.org/). It allows people to do async iteration in a functional style, a la Underscore.js. But a Promise library like q, combined with a few clever techniques, can do just about anything that the much heavier Async.js can do. In this talk, we'll see how: how to run an arbitrary array of async functions in series or in parallel; how to perform async collection operations like map; and more. Well look at both simplified code snippets and real examples from my connect-assets library. This talk will be aimed primarily at Node.js developers. Although the same idioms and libraries could be used in the browser, in practice powerful async task management is rarely needed there.",25 minutes,223 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/91b9c055e068e/assets/5812259/file.mp4
,Who Killed My Battery: Analyzing Mobile Browser Energy Consumption - Angela Nicoara,"Despite the explosive growth of smartphones and growing popularity of mobile web browsing, the energy consumed by a phone browser while surfing the web is poorly understood. While web pages are often optimized for speed and beauty, little attention is given to the amount of energy needed to download and render the page. In this talk, we present an infrastructure for measuring the precise energy used by a mobile browser to render web pages. We then measure the energy needed to render financial, e-commerce, email, blogging, news and social networking sites. Our tools are sufficiently precise to measure the energy needed to render individual web elements, such as cascade style sheets (CSS), Javascript, images, and plug-in objects. Our results show that for popular sites, downloading and parsing cascade style sheets and Javascript consumes a significant fraction of the total energy needed to render the page. Using the data we collected we make concrete recommendations on how to design web pages so as to minimize the energy needed to render the page. We conclude by estimating the point at which offloading browser computations to a remote proxy can save energy on the phone. Our approach gives another dimension for evaluating mobile web sites and helps web developers build more energy efficient sites and improve user experience.",40 minutes,358 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/06e8d5558dfea/assets/5813639/file.mp4

,Benchmarking the New Front End: How to Quantify Single Page App Performance - Rachel Myers and Emily Nakashima,"It's easy to quantify page load time in traditional web apps - there are great services for data collection (Google Analytics, New Relic), comprehensive APIs for slicing it up (Navigation Timing), and even static analysis tools (YSLow, Page Speed Insights, Web Page Test). But as web interactions increasingly load content asynchronously and more application functionality moves to the client, quantitatively understanding your users' experiences becomes a lot more difficult. Time-to-window-load isn't relevant anymore. To benchmark our performance progress we needed to collect new events that correspond to when customers can use different components of the page. In practical terms, the new benchmark is when you remove the loading spinner - but here be dragons. We want to know when we remove all the spinners. Feature by feature, on all the pages. For all of our users. So we want RUM, real user monitoring. We think its the best way to have a real-world metric that you can use to understand your users experience. Well talk about the custom aggregator that we built to slice up some of this data, but well also talk about how you can adapt familiar tools to get some of this data right now. Well end with a short discussion of where these tools still don't meet our needs, and where we hope they'll go next.",36 minutes,323 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/833eded38f1da/assets/5812016/file.mp4

,Browser Versions Are Dead - Kyle Simpson,"The browser version is a dead concept. You must stop caring about the browser version, its update cycle, and even (to some extent), its intrinsic capabilities. Every single person who's ever worked in web development has, more or less, been fed a lie. Its a lie thats so insidious that its actually mutated the way our web development industry works from the inside out. It's made us worse as an industry. Its cost untold billions of dollars in lost time. What is that lie? The browser version matters, because that's how we know what it can and cant do. Or, put another way, The browser version matters, because we have to know how to hack it so that it looks the same as every other browser. The browser version is dead. Hacking around browser short-falls is dead. Compensating for non-compliance to standards is dead. UA sniffing is dead. Quit wasting your time! Lets start retraining decision makers (customers, bosses, etc) about how the web and browsers really work.",44 minutes,392 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/5a7bcbbc51033/assets/5812069/file.mp4

,Creating Animated Music Videos with CSS3 and HTML5 - Rachel Nabors,"When Rachel Nabors transitioned to web design from comics four years ago, the first thing she wanted to do was animate a cartoon in the browser. But instead of learning Flash, she was more interested in mastering CSS and JavaScript. For a long time animating with JavaScript was limiting and resource intensive. There was no simple way to incorporate audio. But things have drastically changed in the past year with widespread adoption of CSS3 animations and HTML5 audio. You can do much without using JavaScript at all, and when you do use JavaScript, you can accomplish so much more! In this talk, Rachel will show you the basic techniques any front-end developer or ambitious designer can use to reproduce classic animation techniques like walkcycles and ""cut-outs."" Then she shows you how to combine them all into a cohesive whole. Whether or not the browser is the next animation platform, you're sure to come away with a deeper understanding of bleeding edge CSS and how to control its interactions with audio and JavaScript.",38 minutes,343 MB,http://mediaservice.mirror-image.com/videos/4c624fe703dbe/assets/5812161/file.mp4
